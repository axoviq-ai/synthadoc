    is_rollback=True with slug=None means "roll back" with no page named —
    callers should list recent fixes so the user can choose.

    Known limitation (inherited from the original ContentHealthResolverWorkflow
    matcher): "roll back" as a literal substring of unrelated prose still
    matches — this is a plain substring search, not intent classification.

    The word right after "roll back"/"rollback" is treated as a slug when
    EITHER (a) it is hyphenated (e.g. "alan-turing" — multi-word slugs are
    always hyphenated, so this is safe), OR (b) it is a single word that is
    NOT on a short list of common English filler/pronoun words
    (``_ROLLBACK_FILLER_WORDS``: "this", "our", "page", "the", ...).  So
    "roll back turing" yields slug "turing", while "roll back this page" and
    "roll back our expectations" yield slug=None.

    Known limitation of heuristic (b): any single English word NOT on the
    filler list is still taken as a slug — e.g. "roll back quickly" yields
    slug "quickly".  A wrong slug fails
    safely — the rollback tool reports no fix recorded for it — so this is
    accepted, in the same spirit as the substring-match limitation above.
