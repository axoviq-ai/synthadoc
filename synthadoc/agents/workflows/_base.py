    #   Use when: the tool itself can compose a concrete, informative confirm
    #   message without any LLM help (e.g. it already holds the list of files
    #   it's about to overwrite).
    #   How: call ``await tool_confirm(ctx, message=...)`` inside the dangerous
    #   tool function.  Leave GATED_TOOLS = frozenset() (the default).
    #   Example: ScaffoldWorkflow / tool_run_scaffold in _tools.py.
    #
    # Pattern B — declarative GATED_TOOLS (this attribute)  ← use this by default
    #   Use when: the confirm message should include data the LLM gathered via
    #   earlier tool calls (e.g. "Found 7 broken links on pages A, B, C").
    #   How:
    #     1. Return a "confirm" entry in get_tool_fns (functools.partial is fine).
    #     2. Declare GATED_TOOLS = frozenset({"my_write_tool"}).
    #   The framework (build_guarded_tool_fns below) then:
    #     • Wraps "confirm" so that confirmed=True opens the session gate.
    #     • Wraps each GATED_TOOLS entry so it fires a fallback dialog if the
    #       LLM skips the confirm step — no write ever happens without approval.
    #     • Once the gate is open, subsequent calls to gated tools run directly.
    #   Examples: BrokenWikilinksWorkflow, IngestLintWorkflow, OrphanResolverWorkflow.
    #
    # Read-only workflows (no wiki writes) do not override this attribute at all —
    # the empty default below is the correct value and build_guarded_tool_fns
    # becomes a no-op when it is empty.
