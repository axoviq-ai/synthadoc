    Orphan resolution never writes to the orphan page itself — it edits the

    lives on that host page, not on orphan_slug, and a direct
    tool_rollback_last_fix(orphan_slug) call fails with "no prior fix
    recorded" even though the orphan was genuinely just resolved.

    "Roll back orphan_slug" has exactly one correct meaning when the host
    page is unambiguous: undo the edit that resolved it, which can only be
    done by restoring that host page — there is nothing on orphan_slug
    itself to undo. So when exactly one host page carries the fix, this
    rolls it back directly rather than asking the user to name it
    themselves, but the returned message says explicitly which page was
    restored and why, so it's never mistaken for a rollback of orphan_slug.
    Only when the host page is genuinely ambiguous (more than one linking
    page has a pending fix) or there plainly isn't one does this hold off
    and report instead of guessing.

    Returns:
        {"status": "success", "slug", "rolled_back_to_snapshot", "message"}
